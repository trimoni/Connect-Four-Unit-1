Colorful Connect Four is a Connect Four re-creation! The board is built with 6 rows & 7 columns. Circles on the board can be clicked in order to start the game, dropping the Red & Yellow piece to the bottom of the board. The main objective of the game is to get a four-in-a-row of either a Red or Yellow circle in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal position. If the player achieves a four-in-a-row, they will win. If the game ends in a tie, the user can reset the game (which they can do at any given point of time) and play again! There is a Dance Button which plays background music, and a fun disco ball circling around the board adding atmosphere to the game!
